# Century_inverted_4per1000
Daily Century SOC model with inversion algorithm to calculate carbon inputs required to increase SOC stocks by 4 per 1000.

The original Century model was developed by Parton et al. (1988).
The matricial version of the model was provided by Yuanyuan Huang (Yuanyuan Huang yuanyuanhuang2011@gmail.com) in matlab code.
Translation to python and further code developments (i.e. parameters calibration, inversion algorithm and uncertainties quantification) were made by Elisa Bruni (ebruni93@gmail.com).
